## General project information

This product was developed as part of a fourth-year project in the Embedded Systems program at Polytech Lille. It consisted of __producing several operating models of an FPGA and comparing its performance and hardware uses__. The VHDL files were written using the Vivado editor.
The model files are in the _'VDHL'_ directory, each with a README describing the observations and what has been done.

## Models carried out

 - Multiplier and reset
 - RAM Inference
 - Inout
 - Large adder
 - Complex Multiplier and pipeline
 - Processor
